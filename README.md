# Hack-A-Thing-1/IoT and LED's


## What you built? 

I was interested in IoT and especially how they interact with other devices, especially LED lights.  I also got a 
Raspberry Pi and have little to now experience with using it or building with it.  Therefore, I wanted to use this 
hack-a-thing to start building a project idea I've had for a while.  The project is much too big for this scope, so I
decided to try and start building a file sharing system between my Raspberry Pi and computer (didn't work out so great),
and also worked with some engineering heavy stuff and got my Raspberry Pi to do some basic LED lighting with a 
breadboard and Pi Wedge.

## Who Did What?

I did everything due to working alone.

## What you learned

I had a lot of fun with the breadboard and engineering part of this Hack-a-Thing.  I don't have any experience with
prototyping and have always thought it would be cool to learn.  During this, I learned a bunch of basics regarding the
breadboard, wiring, and electronics/circuits in general that I didn't know about before.  Further, I had to learn about
GPIO in detail to interact between the breadboard and Raspberry Pi using the Pi Wedge provided.  Specifically for this 
project, I also learned about the specifics of LEDs.  For example:  how rate plays such a large part in their 
brightness and how these can be controlled with MOSFETs for more programmable control.  Further, I tried to start linking
my computer and Raspberry Pi by building a file sharing system of sorts between my Pi and personal laptop.  Unfortunately,
I couldn't quite get this working due to the time constraint, but I was able to connect but ran into package drops, I
think, when trying to send stuff.  Overall, the main lesson I learned regarding IoT is it takes time to get things to
work together.  The technological differences, whether tha be baud rate, voltage, or software differences, are huge
commitments of time and hard work.
